## Introduction

Adapted the hooker debugging command line tool for Windows operating system in the project https://github.com/CreditTone/hooker.

The original project author said, "hooker only supports running on Linux and MacOS, and will not support the Windows operating system now or in the future! There is no soul in developing on Windows!" 
Indeed, it is true that my company only provided Windows devices in the development environment, and I happen to particularly like the syntax of powershell relative to shell, so I made this soulless adaptation. I hope the original author can understand hahaha.

## Running Method

```powershell
.\hooker.ps1
```

## Usage

Still recommend the tool usage introduction in the original project address: https://github.com/CreditTone/hooker
The original author's README is written in a very easy-to-understand way ~
